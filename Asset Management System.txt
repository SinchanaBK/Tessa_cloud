Asset Management System
1. Understanding of Requirements
The client requires a centralized software solution to manage and track company-owned physical assets. The primary pain point is accountability: the system must clearly show the "chain of custody" for every item, identifying exactly which employee is currently in possession of a specific asset.

2. Creative Freedoms & Scope
Product Name: EquipTrack (Placeholder).
Scope: The initial version will be a Web-based Management Portal focused on internal administrative use rather than a public-facing store.
UI: Minimalist "Dashboard" style for quick data entry.

3. Assumptions Made
Single Assignment: An asset can only be assigned to one employee at a time.
Employee Database: The client has an existing list of employees (or we will provide a way to manually add them).
User Roles: There are "Admins" and "Employees".

4. Feature List
Asset Inventory Dashboard: A bird's-eye view of all company property (Laptops, Chairs, Keyboards, etc.) with status indicators (Available, Assigned, In-Repair).
Employee Directory: A searchable list of staff members linked to the assets they are currently holding.
Check-In / Check-Out System: A simple workflow to assign an item to a user with a timestamp and digital "sign-off."
History Logs: A searchable audit trail for each asset showing its previous owners and maintenance history.
Automated Notifications: Email alerts for when an asset is overdue for return or due for a scheduled maintenance check.

5. Questions 
Are there specific categories of assets you want to track beyond IT hardware (e.g., furniture, vehicles, software licenses)?
Do you need to record the physical condition of an item (e.g., "Scratched screen") during the hand-off?
How many total assets and employees are we looking to manage? (This helps determine if we need bulk-upload features).
Should employees be able to log in and see what they are responsible for, or is this for Admin eyes only?
